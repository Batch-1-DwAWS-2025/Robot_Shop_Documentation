# Robot_Shop_Documentation

This document explains the **RobotShop** project! Below is a simple breakdown of the application structure, focusing on the **Web Tier**, **App Tier**, and **DB Tier**. These core layers are defined by the **Development team**. 📝

> **Note**: The DevOps team does not handle these dependencies; they are decided by the **Architects**. 🏗️

## RobotShop Architecture 🚀

---
## 🌐 Web Tier
The **Web Tier** is the front of the application—what users see and interact with! 😎

- **What it does**: Displays the front-end of RobotShop, built with technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (e.g., **React**, **Angular**, or **Node.js**). 🎨
- **How it works**: A **web server** hosts and delivers these front-end pages to users.
- **Web servers**:
  - **Old-school**: Apache Server 🕰️
  - **Modern favorite**: **Nginx**, the go-to web server for speed and reliability! ⚡
- **Purpose**: Ensures users can browse RobotShop smoothly on their browsers. 🌍

## 🛠️ App Tier (API Tier)
The **App Tier** is the brain of RobotShop—handling all the behind-the-scenes logic. 🧠

- **What it does**: Runs the backend code that powers RobotShop, written in languages like **Java**, **.NET**, **Python**, **Go**, or **PHP**. 💻
- **How it works**:
  - In the past, backend apps needed servers like **Tomcat**, **JBoss**, or **IIS** to run. 🖥️
  - Now, most backend technologies come with **built-in servers**—no extra setup needed! 🙌
- **Security note**: The App Tier is **not** exposed to the internet. It only communicates with the **Web Tier** for safety and control. 🔒
- **Purpose**: Processes user requests (like placing an order) and interacts with the database. 🔄

---

## 💾 DB Tier (Database Tier)
The **DB Tier** is where all RobotShop’s data is stored—like a storage room! 📦

- **What it stores**: Important data like **user profiles**, **product details**, **orders**, and more. 🗃️
- **Types of databases**:
  - **RDBMS** (Row & Column Databases): Ideal for structured data, like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, or **MSSQL**. 📊
  - **NoSQL Databases**: Great for flexible data, like **MongoDB** for storing product info. 🗄️
  - **Cache Servers**: Super-fast data access with **Redis** for lightning-speed performance. ⚡
  - **Message Queue (MQ) Servers**: Tools like **RabbitMQ**, **ActiveMQ**, or **Kafka** for handling tasks asynchronously (e.g., sending order confirmation emails). 📬
- **Purpose**: Keeps data safe, organized, and ready for quick access when needed. 🔍

---

## How It All Connects 🔗
- The **Web Tier** communicates with users through their browsers and passes requests (like "add to cart") to the **App Tier**. 🖱️
- The **App Tier** processes these requests and interacts with the **DB Tier** to fetch or save data. 🛠️
- The **DB Tier** stores all the data and responds to the App Tier’s requests, ensuring everything runs smoothly. 📚

This layered setup keeps RobotShop secure, fast, and scalable! 🚀

> **Fun Fact**: The **Web Tier** is like the shop’s storefront, the **App Tier** is the cashier processing orders, and the **DB Tier** is the stockroom keeping everything in order! 🏬
